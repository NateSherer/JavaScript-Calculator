Make A calculator using JavaScript
Hello my name is Nate Sherer.

I started of by making each input a button and using the "onClick" function so that when I click it I can later validate it using javaScript later on in the code.

For my calculator I used the the "display flex" function to make my "calculator" box be centered.

I also used the "display grid" fucntion to make my buttons apprear in a grid like way for easy access to each button.

For JavaScript I created 3 functions named ( buttonDisplay, clearDisplay, and calculate) to specifically target each function that will take place.

In the buttonDisplay function i added the display.value to equal the input, making it so that each time you click a button on the calculator it will show up in the display box or the input box.

For the clearDisplay function I set the clearDisplay function to an empty string so that when you click the "C" button it will clear it just like how the string is clear.

I am going to try and calculate the JavaScript but if all fails (eval) will be used.

For the calculate fuction I used the "eval" property which evaluates all mathmatical equations and integers so they will display in the input box.

Also for the calculator function I used the "try" and "catch" statements so that if the user tries to enter a certain input and that input is invalid the code will "catch" it and then display and "Error".

I am gonna try another way to calculate the JavaScript but if all fails (eval) will be used.
